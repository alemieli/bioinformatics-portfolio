## About Me

Molecular biologist with hands-on laboratory experience in molecular cloning, gene expression analysis, and plant biotechnology. Currently expanding my skill set in bioinformatics and computational biology, with a focus on RNA-seq data analysis and transcriptomics.

## Skills

**Molecular Biology:** PCR, RT-qPCR, cloning (Gateway), DNA/RNA extraction, bacterial transformation, genotyping

**Bioinformatics:** RNA-seq analysis (FastQC, Trimmomatic, HISAT2, featureCounts, DESeq2), basic Python (BioPython), R (data analysis, visualization)

**Tools:** Linux/Terminal, RStudio, primer design (BLAST)

## Projects

### [RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline](./RNA-seq-tutorial)
Complete workflow for differential gene expression analysis starting from raw FASTQ files, including quality control, alignment, quantification, and statistical analysis with DESeq2.
